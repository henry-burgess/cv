  {\large\textbf{Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis \hfill Software Engineer II}}

  \textit{September 2021 - Present \hfill St. Louis, United States}

  Led the full software development lifecycle for various complex research projects, ensuring timely delivery of software solutions critical to neuroscientific advancements. Implemented multiple full-stack web applications to present complex 2D stimuli and collect behavioral data from 30 participants in-person and online across two continents. Pioneered the creation of three unique virtual reality paradigms using Unity and WebXR, successfully gathering behavioral data from 10 participants. Conceptualized and implemented a metadata management web application to store and index scientific metadata associated with animal research artefacts. Utilized MongoDB with TypeScript, React, and Chakra UI to present a responsive interface managing hundreds of metadata records and enabling multi-parameter query searches across all records within 200ms. Awarded a partnership with Georgia Institute of Technology to oversee development of additional features.

  % Personal Life
  \section*{\centering\uppercase{Personal Life}}

  Outside of work, I appreciate a variety of outdoor hobbies including backpacking and running. While in the USA, I have taken the opportunity to explore many National Parks and have hiked to the highest point in the contiguous United States, Mt. Whitney (14,505ft). Completing my first half-marathon in 2022, I enjoy running both as a hobby and stress-reliever around the expansive Forest Park in my current home of St. Louis. Cooking is an everyday hobby that I enjoy after returning home from work, and I often enjoy the opportunity to cook and host for others.
