  % Personal Life
  \section*{\centering\uppercase{Personal Life}}

  Outside of work, I appreciate a variety of outdoor hobbies including backpacking and running. While in the USA, I have taken the opportunity to explore Yosemite and Joshua Tree National Parks and have hiked to the summit of Mt. Whitney (14,505ft). Completing my first half-marathon in 2022, I enjoy running both as a hobby and stress-reliever around the expansive Forest Park in my current home of St. Louis. Cooking is an everyday hobby that I enjoy after returning home from work, and I often enjoy the opportunity to cook and host for others.
